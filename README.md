# CPSC-4800---Assignment-3
Assignment 3 for the course CPSC - PDD in Data Analytics

This is a part of an assignment, to push the project into GitHub.
Find below more informations regarding the exercise and the codes into the notebook.

Exercise 2
For this exercise , you will be working with the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. This is a very famous data set and very often is a student’s first step in Data Analytics!
The Dataset has been given to you on D2L. You need to download the .csv file from your assignment folder. The above link is just for a reference story about the data.

1- For this assignment, you need to perform explorotary data analysis and answer at least three hypotheses based on the dataset. You may need to use your knowledge of statiscts to analyze this data.
Here are three possible hypotheses that you can define for this dataset (you can define your own hypotheses as well):
Determine if the survival rate is associated to the class of passenger
Determine if the survival rate is associated to the gender
Determine the survival rate is associated to the age
2- For each hypothesis, you need to make at least one plot.
3- Write a summary of your findings in one page (e.g., summary statistics, plots) and submit the pdf file. Therefore, for part 2 of your assignment, you need to submit one jupyter notebook file and one pdf file.
This will be your first end to end data analysis project. For this assignment, you will be graded on you overall analysis, and your final report.
4- Push your code and project to github and provide the link to your code here.
